3. Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!!!!

Always make more then 4 pull requests.

Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,

but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 

then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.

If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.

I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..

keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest
